Abstract:
  contemporary microphones and web browsers provide a capable tool for audio signal processing
introduction:
  minor description of browsers, javascript
  defense of utility of javascript despite it's lack of use in academic settings
  quick description of basic analyses one can do with sound signals
section 1:
  brief description of what a fourier spectrum is
  making a toy spectrometer with javascript and the browser
  using it to see spectral differences in different instruments playing the same note
  (featured example)
section 2:
  describing uses of fourier spectrum,
    parseval's theorem and power
  making a power graph of sound
  talking about how power spectrum is calculated from fourier spectrum
  (possible exploration in psychophysics where different pitches may seem louder despite equivalent power)
conclusion
  summarizing two toy analyses
  suggest further examples
